''' 
You've learned some basic Python concept, now it's time to exercise your skills!

There are 10 exercises in this folder, each in its own folder.
Each folder has a 'name_of_the_exercise.py' file and a 'test.py' file.
(If you happen to see a '__pycache__' folder, just ignore it)

This file is an example of a 'name_of_the_exercise.py' where you are asked
implement the function that is defined in the 'test.py' file.

Go ahead and delete line 25 and implement what the instructions on top of the 
function tell you to do.

Please don't change the name of the function or the parameters it takes.
Your task is to implement the function, not to change its signature.

When you're done, run the 'test.py' file to see if your implementation is correct.
In this folder, you will go to 'then_finish_here.py' and follow the instructions there.

# This is an example of a function that you need to implement
# For this function specifically, you need to return the number 42


def return_magic_number() -> int:
    pass  # TODO: Delete this line and implement the function
