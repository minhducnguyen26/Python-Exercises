'''
This exercise contains 4 functions that you need to implement.
Looks like a lot, but they are all very similar to each other.

# Write a function that sorts a list of words alphabetically.
# Example: ["Hello", "World", "Apple", "Banana"] -> ["Apple", "Banana", "Hello", "World"]
def sort_words_alphabetically_in_list(words: list) -> list:
    pass  # TODO: Delete this line and implement the function


# Write a function that sorts a all words in a string alphabetically.
# Example: "Hello World Apple Banana" -> "Apple Banana Hello World"
def sort_words_alphabetically_in_string(string: str) -> str:
    pass  # TODO: Delete this line and implement the function


# Write a function that sorts a list of words by their length.
# Example: ["Hello", "World", "Apple", "Banana"] -> ["Apple", "Banana", "World", "Hello"]
def sort_words_by_length_in_list(words: list) -> list:
    pass  # TODO: Delete this line and implement the function


# Write a function that sorts a all words in a string by their length.
# Example: "Hello World Apple Banana" -> "Apple Banana Hello World"
